# Week 4, Day 4 Discussion Questions

Take 30 minutes to discuss the following questions with your table group. 

1 . Map the CRUD actions to the appropriatea Sinatra route to the appropriate view, if any. What kind of HTTP request is sent for each CRUD action (`GET`, `POST`, etc)
2 . Let's say you have build a Sinatra app that is a blogging platform. You have a Post and an Author model and you have controllers and routes for the CRUD actions of each model. You sit down at your computer and visit www.youramazingsinatrablog.com/posts:
  * What kind of web request is this making? (i.e. is it a `GET`, `POST`, etc request?)
  * What controller action (i.e. which route in which controller) will recieve that web request?
  * What is the response that your Sinatra app will send back to the client, i.e. the browser?
3 . You have the following form for a new blog post:

```html
<form action="???" method="???">

  <label>Title</label>
  <input type="text" name="post[title]">

  <label>Author</label>
  <input type="text" name="post[author]">

  <label>Content</label>
  <input type="text" name="post[content]">

  <input type="submit">

</form>
```

  * What action and what method should the form be defined to have?
  * Given the correct action and method, what controller action will this form submit the form data to?
  * Draw out the params that would be created by submitting this form?
  * Bonus: Currently, form is structured such that the author field is a simple text field, and the user will have to input the name of an existing author. Can you change the form so that it offers a drop down menu of all of the existing author's from the database? What would the resulting params look like? How would you use these params to make a new post and associate it to the selected author?

4 . Spend a few minutes mapping out a domain model for a parking lot. How would you model the relationship between cars and spaces? How would you keep track of how long a car had been parked in a space? How would you keep track of how much money someone would need to pay for having parked a certain amount of time?

5 . Discuss the REST-ful routes of a Sinatra app. For which routes would you `render` a view and for which would you `redirect to` another route? Why?
